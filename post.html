          Hot stocks cool down, and sector rotation hits even the best market
          darlings. Many names that hit fresh highs a few weeks ago are in the
          market doghouse right now, but quality will eventually win the day on
          Wall Street.
        </p>
        <h6>Datadog</h6>
        <p>
          One of this year's bigger winners reported fresh financials this week,
          and Wall Street wasn't impressed. Shares of the cloud-based provider
          of website uptime tracking, security monitoring, and a growing suite
          of analytical tools declined 6% on Wednesday after posting its
          third-quarter results, and the stock is now 26% below the all-time
          high it hit just four weeks ago. The quarter had everything you would
          expect in an applause-worthy performance. The 61% increase in revenue
          and adjusted profit of $0.05 a share were comfortably ahead of the 50%
          top-line growth and $0.01 a share in net income that analysts
          targeted. Datadog boosted its outlook for all of 2020, and the
          guidance it initiated for the current quarter is also above where the
          pros are parked. Datadog's streak of dollar-based net retention rate
          above 130% (the rate of returning customers who are spending at least
          30% more on Datadog's offerings than a year before) now stretches to
          13 consecutive quarters. Bears can argue that Datadog's valuation was
          stretched when it peaked last month, but with revenue growth outpacing
          expectations, the bullish counter is that the multiple will keep
          retracting organically even as the stock bounces back in the near
          future.
        </p>
        <h6>DraftKings</h6>
        <p>
          I have a love-hate relationship with DraftKings as an investment, but
          there's no denying that it's the top dog in wagering on fantasy
          sports. More importantly, DraftKings is using that pole position as a
          Trojan horse to get its more traditional sportsbook betting platform
          into our heads. DraftKings has been brokering deals with leading
          sports networks, and it's going to pay off a lot sooner than you
          think. Investors were hopping onto DraftKings stock over the summer
          and early fall as pro sports leagues across the country restarted
          their seasons, but investors who once bet on DraftKings are now
          wagering against the niche leader. The stock has fallen 35% since its
          early October highs as of Wednesday's close, and it's well positioned
          to crank out a blowout quarterly report on Friday morning. Revenue
          rose 24% for the quarter that ended in June, and that was without any
          of the major leagues in action. This is a classic pullback that could
          bounce back later this week if it's able to deliver a strong financial
          update.
        </p>
        <h6>Fastly</h6>
        <p>
          The hardest-hit of the three stocks here is Fastly. The next-gen
          content delivery network ranked as one of this year's biggest winners
          until it lowered its guidance four weeks ago, largely as a result of
          losing Tiktok as its largest customer. Investors bailed on Fastly,
          which lost nearly half of its value after declining in 12 of the last
          13 trading days of October. Fastly is now trading 47% below the
          all-time high it established in mid-October. Whenever a company
          slashes its guidance, it's going to raise red flags. Datadog this week
          showed us that even increasing your guidance sometimes isn't good
          enough. However, the end result here is that Fastly is now roughly
          half the company it was a month ago in terms of market valuation. Even
          if TikTok doesn't come back -- and it was a big part of the business,
          constituting nearly 11% of its revenue through the first nine months
          of 2020 -- analysts see revenue growing by at least 30% in 2021.
